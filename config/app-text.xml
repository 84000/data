            There are many ways to get eBooks onto eReader devices. If you already have a reliable method for this, please simply download the texts.
        </p>
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
            However, some devices, such as Amazon Kindle, are optimised for downloading books from their associated store, and getting free books from other sources on to them can be tricky. Most eReaders have a built in web-browser and we have found this to be the simplest way to get free eBooks on to our devices.

        <ol xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
            <li>Open the browser on your device. (On a Kindle this is “Beta-Browser” under the main menu).</li>
            <li>Use the browser to go to http://read.84000.co</li>
            <li>Select “View All Translated Texts.”</li>
