        &lt;p&gt;The Reading Room is a browsable catalogue of all the texts in the Kangyur and Tengyur.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the interest of preserving their traditional structure, the two great canonical collections are here divided into the same sections and subsections as the Degé Kangyur and Tengyur. Each subsection lists all the texts that belong to it in their traditional order, showing details of their titles in English, Tibetan, and Sanskrit, and numbered according to the Tōhoku catalogue. Translation status is indicated in the righthand column, with links to the translation if completed.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Please note that 84000 is initially concentrating its resources mainly on the Kangyur.&lt;/p&gt;
