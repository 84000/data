               the cessation of suffering, and (4) the path leading to the cessation of suffering.

                  <title xml:lang="en">The Sūtra of the Wheel of Dharma</title> contains one of the
                  most well-known teachings of Buddhism: the four truths of the noble ones. These
                  four truths are: (1) The truth of suffering, (2) the truth of the origin of
                  suffering, (3) the truth of the cessation of suffering, and (4) the truth of the
                  path leading to the cessation of suffering. According to traditional accounts,
                  this is the first teaching taught by the Buddha following his attainment of
                  awakening. The Buddha is said to have journeyed from the seat of awakening in
                  Bodhgaya to the Deer Park outside of Varanasi, where he delivered this teaching to
                  his five former spiritual companions. Since this was the first time the Buddha
                  turned the wheel of Dharma, this discourse also became known as <title xml:lang="en">The Sūtra of the Wheel of Dharma</title>, or, more commonly,
                     <title xml:lang="en">The Sūtra of the Turning of the Wheel of Dharma</title>. </p>

               <p tid="4">Although a very brief teaching, this classical presentation of the four
                  truths has remained central to the Buddhist tradition since its very early days.
                  As such, this teaching is also included in all the major canons of Buddhism where
                  versions in Pali, Sanskrit, Chinese and Tibetan are found.<note place="end" index="1" xml:id="UT22084-072-037-84"> For a summary of the Pali, Sanskrit and
                     Chinese sources of this teaching, see Anderson 1999, p. 15-16. See also
                     Bronkhorst 1993, p. 80, no. 200.</note> As for translations into Tibetan, we
                  find the classical presentation of the four truths included in no less than five
                  individual works in the Kangyur. Of these, the following three are closely related
                  and almost verbatim identical:<note place="end" index="2" xml:id="UT22084-072-037-85"> As for these three texts, it appears highly likely
                     that Toh 1 is the source for Toh 301 and Toh 337, but the precise relationship
                     between these three texts has not been established. </note>

                           traditionally placed in the Perfection of Wisdom section but not in fact
                           related to that genre. They were translated from Pali in the 14th century
                           at the monastery of Tharpa Ling by a Sri Lankan monk, Ānandaśrī, and the
                           Tibetan translator Nyima Gyaltsen Pel Zangpo. According to Skilling
                           (1993, p 97), this was during the first decade of the 14th century;
                           Skilling has compared this particular text against the extant Pali <title xml:lang="pi">Dhammachakkappavattanasutta</title> (1993, pp 103-106),
                           and concludes that the Tibetan follows the Pali version but contains some
                           significant omissions that he attributes to an erroneous manuscript or
                           translation errors.</note>

                  Sanskrit, Chinese and Tibetan tend to be very similar, yet all of them contain a
                  number of idiosyncrasies—some minor, others significant—that set them apart from
                  the rest. These differences have been studied in great detail over the last two
                  centuries and a rich body of scholarship on the philological and theoretical
                  aspects of this teaching has emerged.<note place="end" index="7" xml:id="UT22084-072-037-90"> For a summary of modern scholarship on the four
                     truths, see Anderson 1999, pp. 168-211.</note> As a result, we now know that
                  the teaching on the four truths as we today find it included in the various canons
                  is the product of several editorial revisions over the centuries. As such, the
                  “original” version of this teaching remains elusive, as does the role played by
                  this teaching in the earliest days of the Buddhist tradition.<note place="end" index="8" xml:id="UT22084-072-037-91"> See Bronkhorst 1993, pp. 71-85. See also

                  translation presented here has been made on the basis of the Tibetan translation
                  of <title xml:lang="en">The Sūtra of the Wheel of Dharma</title> (Toh 337). As
                  mentioned above, this text is with minor exceptions identical to the corresponding
                  sections in Toh 1 and Toh 331. Toh 337 does not list a translator, but the
                  translator of Toh 1 is listed as the Tibetan Kawa Paltseg (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ka ba dpal brtsegs</foreign>), who was a prolific translator
                  during the early period of Tibetan translations, which took place at the beginning
                  of the 9th century. Unfortunately, the Sanskrit version that formed the basis for
                  Kawa Paltseg’s translation of Toh 1 is no longer extant. The Sanskrit manuscript
                  of this text that is available to us today (Gnoli 1977) has enough differences
                  from the Tibetan translation for us to conclude that it was not the text that was
                  used to produce the Tibetan translation. Nevertheless, it does represent an
                  important witness of the Sanskrit and our translation benefitted greatly from
                  comparing the Tibetan with Gnoli’s edition of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Saṅgha­bheda­vastu</title>. Besides this Sanskrit edition, we based our
                  translation on the Degé print of Toh 1, Toh 301, and Toh 337 and their comparative
                  Pedurma editions.</p>

                     truths, there are twelve aspects in all. For a classical explanation of this
